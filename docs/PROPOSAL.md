Project Proposal (Mhmd Waked - Backend)

As a backend Laravel intern at BabiAuto, my first task is to design and implement a robust API service using PHP Laravel. The API will focus on core functionalities such as vehicle management, booking, user authentication, and partner integrations.

User Management

Registration & Authentication

Secure users by using JWT-based authentication.

Email verification and password reset.

User Profiles

CRUD operations (Create, Delete, Read, Update) for user details (name, contact, driverâ€™s license).

Role-based access (e.g., customer, admin, partner).

Vehicle Management

Fleet Operations

Edit, add, and delete vehicles.

Search filtering by model, type, budget, color, and features.

Maintenance Tracking

Log service history and availability status.

Booking System

Reservations

Book a car, modify bookings, and cancel bookings with date and time validation.

Real-time availability checks.

Pricing & Payments

Pricing changes according to seasonal rates and discounts.

Integration with payment gateways (Whish, cash).
